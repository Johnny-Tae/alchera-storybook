# User Guide

<div className="subheading">1. Component Selection</div>

Click on any one of the expandable list items or standalone components in the sidebar to see its details.

(Shortcut Key) Press "s" to hide/show the sidebar.

<img src={SidebarSelection} alt="sidebar selection" />
<div className="subheading">2. Canvas</div>

The default view state for inspecting Storybook components is named "Canvas".
You can switch between it and the other mode "Docs" at the top options bar as
seen below.

<img src={TopOptionsBar} alt="top options bar" />

To the right of the view state selection are visual options (i.e.- zoom level, background color, etc.)
They can be adjusted per user needs to change the way the rendering window as seen below:

<img src={CanvasExample} alt="canvas example" />

The selected component should be rendered accordingly in this window and is fully interactable to test
and visualize how it would be seen in the interface of the production build.

<div className="subheading">3. Addons</div>

The addons feature provides an interactable interface to observe changes at runtime when altering
one or more properties for a component.

The "Controls" tab shows a list of all props and events that are associated with the selected component.
Each prop has a "control" that can be interacted with to change the inputted data, whether that be value
or format.
Depending on the designated data type, each prop has a specific UI that allows for ease of change.

For example:

Boolean values have a clickable toggle.

<img src={ControlsBoolean} alt="boolean toggle" />

While the data type can be set to accept strings, the storybook may set its control to be that of a
dropdown list or radio buttons to provide preset options.
For a prop that takes a string value for color as input, a special swatch control is used.
The bottom portion of this control is populated with preset colors that are primarily shown in
Alchera-affiliated UIs.

(Shortcut Key) Press "a" to hide/show addons.

<img src={ControlsColor} alt="color swatch" />

Below the list of props are all "events" that are emitted when certain conditions are met.
These events should be detected by an event listener when it is utilized in a project.
